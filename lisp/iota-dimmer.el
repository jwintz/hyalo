;;; iota-dimmer.el --- Inactive window dimming -*- no-byte-compile: t; lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2025
;; Author: Julien Wintz <julien.wintz@inria.fr>
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "30.0"))
;; Keywords: faces, windows, dimming

;;; Commentary:

;; Dimmer provides automatic dimming of inactive window contents.
;; Unlike other dimmer packages, this one:
;;   - Preserves syntax highlighting by adjusting each face's colors
;;   - Is compatible with modern packages (vertico, which-key, transient)
;;   - Respects theme transparency handling
;;
;; The dimming is achieved by reducing saturation and luminance in HSL color space
;; for each face, preserving the relative color relationships (syntax highlighting).

(require 'color)
(require 'face-remap)
